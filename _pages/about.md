Hi, I'm Udeepa 👋🏾!

I'm a research engineer based in London at <a href="https://novoic.com/">Novoic</a>. I focus on pre-training and fine-tuning large language models and multimodal models for the early-stage detection of Alzheimer's disease from a patient's speech.

I completed my masters in Machine Learning at the <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/">University College London</a>, where I worked with <a href="https://rockt.github.io/">Tim Rocktäschel</a> and <a href="https://www.egrefen.com/">Edward Grefenstette</a> at the <a href="https://ucldark.com/">UCL DARK Lab</a>. I hold a masters in Physics at the <a href="https://www.ox.ac.uk/">University of Oxford</a>, supervised by <a href="https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~sjrob/">Stephen Roberts</a> in the <a href="https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~parg/">Machine Learning Research Group</a>.
